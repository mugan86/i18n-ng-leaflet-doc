# Markers

Now that [we know how to work with the zoom controls](../zoom/positions-btn-texts.md), we are going to start working with the elements that will give more play to the maps, **the markers**.

In this section we will learn the following:
* [Add a marker and center the camera based on this marker.](./one-marker.md)
* [Add two or more markers and center the camera based on the added markers.](./two-or-more-markers.md)
* [Add random markers with default zoom and adjusting camera based on added markers.](./random-markers-default-zoom.md)
* [Add markers with different levels of zoom and camera adjustment with these elements. default and adjusting camera based on added markers.](./random-markers-select-zoom.md)
* [Colour selection marker](./marker-with-select-color.md)
